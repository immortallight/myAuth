// It looks like you are seeing a warning related to the process.binding('http_parser') method being deprecated. This warning appears because this method has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version of Node.js. You can use the --trace-deprecation flag to see where the warning was created.

// You are also seeing warnings related to multiple modules with names that only differ in casing. This can happen when you have files or directories with the same name but different capitalization in your project. For example, if you have both a pro.js and a pro.JS file, this can cause issues when building your project. To fix this, you should ensure that all file and directory names within your project use the same capitalization.
